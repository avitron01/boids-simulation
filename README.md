# boids-simulation
A simple flocking simulation project inspired from ['Coding Challenge #124: Flocking Simulation'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhjuuHl6qHM).

Implemented using SpriteKit & Xcode

## TODO:
- ~Implement spatial subdivision rather the naive approach followed currently.~ (Done âœ…)
- Maybe implement Quad tree to benchmark difference between spatial subdivision.
- UI to change various paramter of flocking system
- Obstacle avoidance system.
